**My IP** is a simple, fast, and elegant web tool that helps you instantly find your public IP address and other key connection details. Whether you're a developer, a privacy enthusiast, or just curious, this tool provides the information you need in a clean and intuitive interface.

## üöÄ Features

* **Instant IP Lookup:** Get your IP address as soon as you load the page.
* **Detailed Information:** Displays your **ISP** (Internet Service Provider), **geographical location** (city and country), and **device type**.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive, and beautiful design that looks great on any device.
* **Blazing Fast:** Deployed on **Cloudflare Pages** for unparalleled performance and global availability.
* **One-Click Copy:** Easily copy your IP address to the clipboard with a single click.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** For the project's core structure.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For fast, utility-first styling and a professional look.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For fetching data from external APIs and handling dynamic content.
* **IP-API:** A free and reliable API used to fetch IP-related information.
* **Cloudflare Pages:** For hosting and Continuous Deployment (CD).

## üí° How It Works

The website uses a simple **JavaScript** `fetch` request to call the `ip-api.com` service. The API responds with a JSON object containing the user's IP, ISP, country, and city. The JavaScript then updates the HTML elements on the page with this information, providing a seamless and quick user experience.
